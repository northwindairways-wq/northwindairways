      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Northwind Air™ was born from the evolution of Falconix Air—a bold startup concept focused on luxury experimentation. Under the leadership of founder Luke Schmidt, the brand transitioned into a scalable, mainline carrier with a legacy-inspired identity. Today, Northwind Air™ operates a modern fleet, offers structured cabin classes, and reflects the values of clarity, authenticity, and operational excellence.</p>
